# FinalProject_BusinessCaseStudy
📌 Project Overview

This repository contains the complete SQL implementation of a Business Case Study developed as a final academic project. The purpose of this project is to design and implement a relational database system and perform business-oriented data analysis using SQL.
The project demonstrates the practical application of database design principles, data modeling, and structured querying to extract meaningful insights that support business decision-making.

🎯 Project Objectives
The main objectives of this project were:

Design a normalized relational database schema
Create structured tables with appropriate constraints Establish relationships using primary and foreign keys Populate tables with relevant business data
Write analytical SQL queries to answer key business questions  .Generate insights that support data-driven decisions

📄 finalprojectBCS.sql Includes:

Database creation statements
Table definitions
Primary & foreign key constraints
Data insertion statements
Business analysis queries
Aggregate functions and grouped reports

🛠 Technologies Used
SQL

Relational Database Management Systems:

MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQL Server (compatible with standard SQL syntax)

🧱 Database Design

The project follows relational database principles including:

✅ Entity Definition

Tables are created to represent key business entities such as:

Customers

Products / Services

Orders / Transactions

Employees (if applicable)

Sales records

(Adjust this list if your schema differs.)

✅ Relationships

One-to-Many relationships implemented via foreign keys

Referential integrity enforced

Data consistency maintained using constraints

✅ Normalization

Tables structured to reduce redundancy

Proper separation of entities

Logical schema design

📊 Business Questions Addressed

The SQL queries in this project are designed to answer real-world business questions such as:

What are the top-performing products?

Which customers generate the highest revenue?

What is the total sales performance over time?

Which regions or categories perform best?

What trends can be identified in transaction data?

📈 Analytical Techniques Used

The project demonstrates strong SQL analytical capabilities, including:

SELECT statements with filtering (WHERE)

JOIN operations (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN)

GROUP BY with aggregate functions:

SUM()

COUNT()

AVG()

MAX()

MIN()

ORDER BY for ranking analysis

Subqueries (if included)

Conditional filtering (HAVING clause)

🚀 How to Run the Project

📌 Key Learning Outcomes

Through this project, the following skills were developed and demonstrated:

Database schema design

Logical data modeling

Writing complex SQL queries

Business data interpretation

Analytical thinking

Structured problem-solving

Query optimization basics

💡 Real-World Application

This project simulates how businesses:
